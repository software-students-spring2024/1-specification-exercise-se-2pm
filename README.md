## Stakeholders

Wei Luo

Stakeholder 1

+ The user community is focused on college students this product.

+ +Design and advertisement are specifically targeting college students

- -No public forum to exchange information.

- -Inventive is not necessary for this app to be active.

Stakeholder 2

Minjae Lee

Stakeholder 3

+ +Wants to see a photo review of restaurants showing food, design, menu, etc around the campus

+ +Wants to click on the restaurant to see the location, opening time, average price, menu, possibly using a map.

- -Business owners are not able to react to wrong reviews, or problems that were true before but are fixed now. There could be a feature to fix this frustration.

- -There should be an incentive to review such as providing coupons.

- -Does not want to see wrong or random reviews of people who did not even visit the place. There could be a feature to filter or validate people if they actually visited the place (e.g. scanning receipt)

Stakeholder 4

+ +Wants to see a video review of restaurant

+ +Wants to save/bookmark a restaurant while scrolling through reviews. 

+ +Wants to see likes/views feature to know how helpful the review was for other people. This could also lead to giving incentive to people to review.

+ +Wants to directly make a reservation through the app.

+ +Wants to see public polls to understand what others think about a certain place, (E.g. McDonalds vs Burger King) and also to interact more with the app.

- -There should be an incentive to review such as providing coupons. 

- -Communication may not be necessary among peers, so direct messages could be unnecessary. DMs could add to the stress of talking to random people online. Prefers comments.

Stakeholder 5

+ +Want to be able to view ratings and reviews, as well as being able to sort by ratings and reviews

+ +Want to emphasize locations that are more targeted towards students such as restaurants closer to campus or quiet study spaces for getting work done.

- -There should be incentives to leave high quality reviews with comments and pictures

- -High quality reviews can contribute towards tickets for giveaways and prizes

Stakeholder 6

+ +Wants to be able to view interesting places around campus and navigate to them through a map

+ +Wants to be able to review spaces/restaurants around campus through a multi-starred system based around pre-determined parameters

- -Dissatisfied with recommendations for food/campus life currently available and would like a place where everything can be aggregated with high-quality recommendations

- -Public forums about college campuses tend to be repetitive and not as informative as they would like and would like a better system
